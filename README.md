# 📊 User Clustering - by.U

This project is a simulation of user segmentation for by.U based on their mobile data usage behavior using **K-Means Clustering**. The goal? Identify different types of users—those who are data-hungry, minimal users, and loyal but idle ones. Great for behavior analysis and data-driven decision-making.

## 🧠 Features
- Data preprocessing with `StandardScaler`
- Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- K-Means Clustering implementation
- Visualized clustering results using Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🐍 Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📷 Visualization

Cluster visualization based on `Total_Data_GB` vs `Daily_Usage_GB`:
